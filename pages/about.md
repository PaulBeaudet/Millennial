## What is equality?

> Even if you're an athist, for a momement put your perception in the eyes of higher power. Relieze that humanity is a group of hairless apes and look at them like you would look at any other group of animals. Would you see as many differences amoung people as you do now?
>
> Humans are all basically the same creatures in this view. Descriminating subtle unique features is a process of survival among and inside sub groups of life. Where a narrow difference of strength, endurance, and consideration are keenly discriminated. Often differance that defines survivability. As a higher power there are no such consiquences. Its probably why you think all squirles basically look the same, consiquences of their differences are not that applicable to your condition
>
> Call to question if all of these narow differances define the survivability of the species or the individual seeds. Humans pass on more than their genetic traits, they also pass on tools of survivability. Tools that bridge gaps between individuals. In that light what differances really matter? When do differances become a matter of veriety as opposed to a matter of superiority?

## Bio

I implement and create technology to be utilized as equlizing force to empower people to work together. My compultion for making gets directed into, open source software developement, entrepenuership, and photography. Many say I'm smart but mostly I see myself as persistent, ready to learn, undetered by complexity. After all you have to see something scary if you ever want to be brave. Wrapping complexity in simplicity is my idea of minimalism. Its more about having stuff that actually gets used then having less stuff. My focuses are driven by ideas of empowerment and sustainability. Having co-founded Manchester Makerspace, and serving as its educational programs manager, I'm avid proponent of community workspaces and concept of hands on learning. For fun I like to get out into nature and hike, right now I'm working on the 4000 footers in the White Mountains of NH.
