Hi there! I'm Paul. I’m a idiot turned programmer. Ever since I first learned how to program while building alternative keyboards, I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a career. Here is a compilation of some of my favourite things that I have built over the years on my <a href="http://github.com/PaulBeaudet" target="_blank">Github</a> page.

### Whats going on here

I'm testing a github pages theme, great job @lenpaul. Paul is a great first name, that's how I knew this might be some what usable

Also I have never been to cuba  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
